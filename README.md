# Support Act

Support Act is a configurable AppleScript script to set up your Mac for a performance. Use it to check that your system is ready for the gig, then start up apps you need for your gig, and finally starts Gig Performer (or your preferred live software). You can also make another script to restore your settings after the gig too.
